# Notes-App
Notes web page using HTM CSS and JS 
This code creates a web app that allows users to create and save notes. The app has a button that allows users to add new notes.
When a user clicks on the add button, a new note is added to the app.
The app also saves the notes in the user's local storage, so that they can access their notes even after they close the app.
