Let's go through the code line by line to understand it better:

const addBtn = document.getElementById('add')

This line of code gets the "add" button element from the HTML file and assigns it to a variable called "addBtn". We will use this variable to add an event listener to the button.

const notes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('notes'))

This line of code retrieves the notes that were previously saved in the user's local storage. It uses the "getItem" method of the "localStorage" object to retrieve the notes from local storage, and then parses the notes using the "JSON.parse" method. The parsed notes are assigned to a variable called "notes".
  notes.forEach(note => addNewNote(note))  
}```

This code block checks if there are any notes stored in the local storage. If there are notes, it loops through each note using the "forEach" method and calls the "addNewNote" function for each note. This function adds a new note to the app using the note's text.

```addBtn.addEventListener('click', () => addNewNote())```

This line of code adds an event listener to the "add" button. When the button is clicked, the "addNewNote" function is called to add a new note to the app.

```function addNewNote(text = '') {```

This line of code declares a function called "addNewNote". This function takes an optional "text" parameter, which is used to set the initial text of the note. If no text is passed in, the default value of an empty string is used.

```const note = document.createElement('div')  
  note.classList.add('note')  
  note.innerHTML = `  
  <div class="tools">  
    <button class="edit"><i class="fas fa-edit"></i></button>  
    <button class="delete"><i class="fas fa-trash-alt"></i></button>  
  </div>  
  <div class="main ${text ? "" : "hidden"}"></div>  
  <textarea class="${text ? "hidden" : ""}"></textarea>  
  `  ```

This block of code creates a new "note" element using the "createElement" method. It then adds two classes to the note element: "note" and "tools". The "innerHTML" property of the note element is set to a template string that contains two divs: one for the tools (edit and delete buttons) and one for the main note content. If the "text" parameter is not empty, the "hidden" class is not added to the main div, so that the note's content is displayed. If the "text" parameter is empty, the "hidden" class is added to the main div, so that the note's content is hidden.

```const editBtn = note.querySelector('.edit')  
  const deleteBtn = note.querySelector('.delete')  
  const main = note.querySelector('.main')  
  const textArea = note.querySelector('textarea')  
  textArea.value = text  
  main.innerHTML = marked(text)```

These lines of code select the edit and delete buttons, as well as the main content div and the text area for the note. The "value"
